Perfect — here’s the exact Replit “prompt” (command block) you can paste into each of your web app repls to automatically block these WordPress scanner bots before they hit your routes.

You can add this to the top of your main server file (for example, index.js, server.js, or app.py, depending on your stack).

🚀 For Node.js / Express apps

Paste this at the top of your server.js or index.js (before your main routes):

// 🛡️ Basic security middleware to block malicious WordPress bot scans
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const blockedPatterns = [
    '/wp-admin',
    '/wp-login',
    '/xmlrpc.php',
    '/wordpress',
    '/wp-content',
    '/wp-includes',
    '/setup-config.php'
  ];

  const isBlocked = blockedPatterns.some(p => req.url.includes(p));
  if (isBlocked) {
    console.log(`🚫 Blocked malicious request: ${req.url} from ${req.ip}`);
    return res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
  }

  next();
});

✅ What it does:
	•	Instantly blocks requests that contain WordPress-related paths.
	•	Returns a 403 Forbidden response (so the bot leaves).
	•	Logs each blocked attempt so you can see it in the Replit console.

🐍 For Python / Flask apps

Add this middleware near the top of your main Flask file (e.g. main.py):

from flask import Flask, request, abort

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.before_request
def block_wp_bots():
    blocked_patterns = [
        "/wp-admin",
        "/wp-login",
        "/xmlrpc.php",
        "/wordpress",
        "/wp-content",
        "/wp-includes",
        "/setup-config.php"
    ]
    for pattern in blocked_patterns:
        if pattern in request.path:
            print(f"🚫 Blocked malicious request: {request.path} from {request.remote_addr}")
            abort(403)

⚙️ Optional: Add rate limiting (extra safety)

If you want to limit the number of requests from any single IP, install and add express-rate-limit (for Node.js):

npm install express-rate-limit

Then in your server file:

import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 60, // limit each IP to 60 requests per minute
  message: "Too many requests, please try again later."
});

app.use(limiter);

🧠 Summary

Problem	Fix
Bots probing /wp-admin/setup-config.php	Block these routes using middleware
Too many unique IPs (bot swarm)	Add rate limiting
Want to see what’s blocked	Logged in console automatically

Would you like me to give you the same prompt for Replit sites running PHP or static HTML (no backend) too?
Those require a small .replit or .htaccess–style tweak instead.
